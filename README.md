# SchutzFlug


> **AI-Powered Autonomous Search & Rescue Drone for Disaster Response**

SchutzFlug is an autonomous drone system designed to support emergency response teams during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, and wildfires. The drone autonomously navigates disaster-affected areas, detects survivors using RGB and thermal imaging, identifies environmental hazards, and generates geo-tagged situational reports to improve rescue operations. By processing data locally on the drone, SchutzFlug provides reliable real-time intelligence even in environments with limited or no network connectivity.

## 📖 Project Overview

Natural disasters often leave behind damaged infrastructure, blocked roads, and hazardous environments, making it difficult for rescue teams to quickly locate survivors. Traditional search-and-rescue operations are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and may expose responders to dangerous conditions.

SchutzFlug addresses these challenges by deploying an autonomous AI-powered drone capable of exploring affected areas, detecting survivors, identifying hazards, and generating live disaster maps. The system provides emergency responders with accurate situational awareness, helping them prioritize rescue efforts while reducing response time and improving overall operational safety.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect survivors using RGB and thermal cameras.
- Identify disaster-related hazards such as fire, smoke, floodwater, debris, and damaged structures.
- Navigate autonomously in both GPS-enabled and GPS-denied environments.
- Generate geo-tagged maps of survivors and hazard zones.
- Operate reliably in communication-constrained environments.
- Provide actionable insights for emergency response teams.
